# Project User List

This time I'm gonna make a faster exercise with the [RANDOM USER GENERATOR API](https://randomuser.me/)

Implement React Navigation
Implement Axios for HTTP Requests

Basically, here I will show the basics about user listings:

- Picture
- Title

I started to ask Postman. So, at this moment I get the data for listings in the application:

It is possible to see the title, user detail:

The route configs object is a mapping from route name to a route config, which tells the navigator what to present for that route.

`navigationOptions`  for screens inside of the navigator
[title]
String that can be used as a fallback for  `headerTitle`
